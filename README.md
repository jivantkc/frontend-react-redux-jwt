# frontend-react-redux-jwt
Creating a frontend using react, redux, jwt, locatStorage
### First Install
To skip the boilerplate I will use the commando below to start the project
    
    npx create-react-app frontend
   
### Second Install:
We are gonna need some packages and install material ui.

    yarn add axios react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit react-router-dom
    yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

### Third Install:
Create Redux Store. This Store will bring Actions and Reducers together and hold the Application state.
Now we need to install Redux, Thunk Middleware and Redux Devtool Extension.
Run the command:

    yarn add redux redux-thunk
    yarn add redux-devtools-extension
